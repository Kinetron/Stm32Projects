## LfSignalGenerator

Low-frequency step signal generator in the range from 3567Hz to 0.1 Hz.

It generated square pulse.
The frequency decreases every 12 seconds.

This allows you to test various signal amplifiers or optical isolators.

Folder \LfSignalGenerator\STM32F103C6T6 contains a project for a microcontroller STM32F103C6T6

Folder STM32F103C8T6 for a microcontroller STM32F103C8T6.

The signal is generated at the output PB11.

The generated frequency list can be found in the file \LfSignalGenerator\FrequencyTable.txt
